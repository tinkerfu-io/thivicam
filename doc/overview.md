# Introduction

If you intend to monitor any situation such as the behavior of a device, what is happening around a building or what is going on in the chicken coop at a certain time, the installation of one or more network cameras will be a suitable solution. This type of equipment has been around for a very long time and is now also affordable for private users. Unfortunately, however, these products have developed in a direction which give the user the feeling that he has only purchased the usage rights for expensive money, but is not really the owner. In most cases, this is implemented in such a way that the user can only use the full range of functions if he registers himself and the product with the manufacturer and then integrates the camera into the cloud of the manufacturer via his own network (Wifi/Lan). Now apart from the fact that customers are not made aware of this fact and thus results in the right for a reversal of the purchase, there are other disadvantages. None of the vendors, especially in the consumer sector, guarantee that the cloud service will be maintained as long as the product is alive, often software bugs are not fixed and quite often the cloud services are poor in terms of security. During a Twitch stream of Thisa_cc the idea arose to develop an IP camera in the context of a community project, which does not have these disadvantages. The idea of the Thivicam was born.

## Boundary Conditions

* The thivicam should be realized as a construction manual, so that someone who is a somewhat technically interested can rebuild it
* The thivicam should use generally available hardware that everyone can by
* The sofware must be opensource so that everyone can adapt it to their own needs
* The thivicam should be a kind of a very basic solution that can be extended by everyone with new features according theire needs (like smoke detection and so forth)
* The thivicam must be usable as a IP Cam via Wifi or Lan, if possible with PoE
* The video feed must be ebeddable in any possible software conforming a standard (Todo: needs some clarification)
